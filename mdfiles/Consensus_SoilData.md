### Consensus Soil Data

The script merges G2F and USDA soil data to create a consensus [file](https://github.com/QuantGen/G2F_RESOURCES/blob/main/Data/OutputFiles/SoilData.csv) with the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|location| G2F field location name |
|year| year when the record was saved |
|dept| (cm) distance from the surface to the bottom of the horizon |
|ph| soil pH level |
|OM| (%) Organic matter |
|N| (ppm) Available nitrates |
|K| (ppm) Potassium |
|S| (ppm) Sulfur from sulfates |
|Ca| (ppm) Calcium |
|Mg| (ppm) Magnesium |
|Na| (ppm) Sodium |
|CEC| (me/100g) Cation exchange capacity |
|P| (ppm) Phosphorus extraction with dilute acid fluoride |
|sand| (%) Sand composition in soil sample |
|silt| (%) Silt composition in soil sample |
|clay| (%) Clay composition in soil sample |
|sandvc| (%) mineral particles 1.0mm to 2.0mm in equivalent diameter |
|sandco| (%) mineral particles 0.5mm to 1.0mm in equivalent diameter |
|sandmed| (%) mineral particles 0.25mm to 0.5mm in equivalent diameter |
|sandfine| (%) mineral particles 0.10mm to 0.25mm in equivalent diameter |
|sandvf| (%) mineral particles 0.05mm to 0.10mm in equivalent diameter |
|siltco| (%) mineral particles 0.02mm to 0.05mm in equivalent diameter |
|siltfine| (%) mineral particles 0.002mm to 0.02mm in equivalent diameter |
|ksat| amount of water that would move vertically through a unit area of saturated soil in unit time under unit hydraulic gradient |
|awc| amount of water that an increment of soil depth, inclusive of fragments, can store that is available to plants |
|wthirdbar| volumetric content of soil water retained at a tension of 1/3 bar (33 kPa), expressed as a percentage of the whole soil |
|wfifteenbar| volumetric content of soil water retained at a tension of 15 bars (1500 kPa), expressed as a percentage of the whole soil |
|wsatiated| estimated volumetric soil water content at or near zero bar tension, expressed as a percentage of the whole soil|
|kwfact| erodibility factor which quantifies the susceptibility of soil particles to detachment and movement by water. This factor is adjusted for the effect of rock fragments |
|caco3| quantity of Carbonate (CO3) in the soil expressed as CaCO3 and as a weight percentage of the less than 2 mm size fraction |
|sar| measure of the amount of Sodium (Na) relative to Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) in the water extract from saturated soil paste |
|ec| electrical conductivity of an extract from saturated soil paste |
|cec7| amount of readily exchangeable cations that can be electrically adsorbed to negative charges in the soil, soil constituent, or other material, at pH 7.0, as estimated by the ammonium acetate method |
